Place your architecture diagram image here so README can display it.

Steps to add the image:

1. Save your diagram as PNG named `flowchart.png`.
2. Put the file at: `legacy/static/flowchart.png` (project relative path).
3. Commit the file to the repository:

   git add legacy/static/flowchart.png
   git commit -m "Add architecture diagram"
   git push

Once the file exists at that path, the project's `README.md` will render the image automatically under "Architecture Diagram".
